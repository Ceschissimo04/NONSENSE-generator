| USER STORY | DESCRIPTION |
|:---|:---|
| As a user,<br>I want the system to analyze the structure of the input sentence<br>So that I can understand its grammatical components | **Empty Input Handling**<br>Given that the input field is empty<br>When I click the "Analyze" button<br>Then the system should display a message informing me that a sentence is required for analysis<br>And no analysis should be performed<br><br>**Parts of Speech Tagging**<br>Given that I have entered a valid sentence<br>When I click the "Analyze" button<br>Then the system should display each word labeled with its part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective) |
| As a user<br>I want the system to fill the template with words from the sentence and dictionary<br>So that I receive a grammatically correct and creative output sentence | **Default Template Handling**<br>Given that I have not selected a specific template<br>When I click the "Generate" button<br>Then the system should automatically use a basic default template to generate the output sentence<br><br>**Fallback to Dictionary**<br>Given that the input sentence does not contain all the necessary word types to complete the template<br>When the system generates the sentence<br>Then it should fill in the missing elements using words from the dictionary that fit the required grammatical roles |
| As a user,<br>I want to select a template and a tense<br>So that the program generates a customized sentence | **Accurate and Customized Sentence Output**<br>Given that I have selected a template and a tense<br>When I generate the sentence<br>Then the generated sentence should be conjugated correctly and follow the structure of the chosen template |
| As a user,<br>I want the system to check the generated sentence for toxic content<br>So that I am not exposed to inappropriate or harmful output | **Blocking Toxic Output**<br>Given that the generated sentence is flagged as toxic<br>When the check is completed<br>Then the sentence should not be displayed to the user<br>And the user should receive a warning or notification explaining that the content was inappropriate<br><br>**Toxicity evaluation**<br>Given that a sentence has been generated<br>When the system checks the sentence for toxicity<br>Then it should return an index of toxicity |
| As a user<br>I want to save the generated sentences in a file<br>So that I can keep a record of them for future reference | **Save Option**<br>Given that I have generated multiple sentences in the same session<br>When I tick the "Save to file" checkbox<br>Then the system should save all generated sentences in a single file, each clearly separated |
| As a user<br>I want to view generated sentences in a file<br>So that I can see the history of generated sentences | **Access to History File**<br>Given that I have previously saved generated sentences<br>When I choose the option to view history<br>Then the system should display the file containing those sentences |
| As a user<br>I want to add terms to dictionary<br>So that the program can use new terms | **Input Validation**<br>Given that I try to add an empty or invalid term<br>When I submit the form<br>Then the system should display an error message and prevent the term from being added<br><br>**Term Availability for Generation**<br>Given that I have added a valid term to the dictionary<br>When I generate a new sentence<br>Then the system should be able to use the new term as part of the sentence if it fits the template |
